# libraries-catalog

Automatically generated API documentation for some of my personal code libraries.

The `refresh.sh` script reads the list of github repositories in `xbuildrepos.txt`, git clones or pulls on each as needed, and
builds API docs with sbt.

I host the output at <http://neelsmith.info/code/auto/>.
